Portable CTF
------------

This distribution contains the Compact ANSI-C Type Format source code,
re-arranged for portability and re-use.

It does not use the system CTF facilities, as those are explicitly labelled
as unstable and subject to change.

Instead, it provides those same APIs as supported functions, but these are
namespaced as pctf (header file and library name; function names are unchanged).
